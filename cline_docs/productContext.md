8. **Entity Filtering** - Support for filtering targetable entity types (4 categories)
9. **Vanilla Compatibility** - Integration without breaking existing gameplay
10. **Multiplayer Optimization** - Stable performance on servers
11. **Better Third Person Integration** - Full compatibility with 3 modes
12. **Professional GUI System** - Multi-page configuration interface
